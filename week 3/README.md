# Week 3 Task 

Create a web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 

A web app that aids you maintain a shopping list that you can add items to and mark items as completed. 

Let me explain a bit further: 

- You’re going to create a page that has a form.
- Each time the form is filled, and a add button is clicked 
- The details of the form are converted into an item that gets added to our shopping list 
- Each item in the shopping list would have a button 
- When the button on an item is clicked, the item is removed from the shopping list 

 

***Requirements:***

- You must use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
- Your page must not reload when an item is added to the shopping list. 
- Your JavaScript must have at least one array variable that stores useful data 
- Your JavaScript must contain at least one object. 
- At least, some part of your code must be explained with comments 
- Your code must use functions. 

 

If you’re confused on how the app would look, I’ve taken the stress of creating a beautiful design that can be found at this [link](https://www.figma.com/file/AmXexOs7MdFilk8SOEA2Fe/Untitled?node-id=1%3A2). You don’t have to follow the design *(It would be nice if you did)* but the design should give you a fair idea of what needs to be done.
