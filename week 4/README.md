# Week 4 Task 

Create a TODO app using ReactJS. 

This web app can help us organize our lives. We can add, remove and even edit items on our todo list. 

Let me explain a bit further: 

	- You’re going to create a page that has a form.
	- This form can have any design you like.
	- Each time the form is filled, and an save button is clicked 
	- The details of the form are converted into a todo-item that gets added to our todo list 
	- Each item in the shopping list would have two buttons
	- A mark as done button, and an edit button 
	- When the 'mark as done' button on an item is clicked, the item's style should change and look like the item is faded or any other way you choose to present a completed task.
	- When the edit button is clicked, the content on the item gets inserted back into the input field and after editing, the save button is clicked again and the content of the item which we were editing get's edited

 

***Requirements:***

	- You must use ReactJS (any css framework is allowed)
	- Your page must not reload when an item is added to the todo list.
	- Your app must contain a **minimum** of 2 components
	- Your app must have a **minimum** of 3 states in total.
	- Each todo item must be an object. 
	- At least, some part of your code must be explained with comments 

 

If you’re confused on how the app would look,you can follow the design for the Shopping List Task found at this [link](https://www.figma.com/file/AmXexOs7MdFilk8SOEA2Fe/Untitled?node-id=1%3A2). You absolutely ***do not need*** to follow the design.
