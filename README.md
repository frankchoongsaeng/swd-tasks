# Your New View

Hey there, this is where you'll find access to most of your tasks. There are different branches on this repository and they divide tasks into different category. 

Example: The **weekly branch** is where you'll find tasks that should take you up to a week to complete.

If you have any questions, please reach out to me, the author and I'll reach right back.



**Okay. Have Fun Coding**
